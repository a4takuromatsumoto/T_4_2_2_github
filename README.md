Hi. Thank you for reading. This software was created by a4(Takuro Matsumoto). I hope to propagate this new way of programming which I call "T language" for building chatbots.

I wrote this software with VisualC++2010. In addition, you may as well set Unicode for building.

The detail information is in my website although it is Japanese. http://www.01ken.com/art1.html
